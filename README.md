# 🧠 Mind in Motion: Supporting Athletes Mentally After Injury

**Mind in Motion** is a student-led initiative and website dedicated to supporting the mental health of student-athletes recovering from injury. While physical rehab is often emphasized, the emotional toll of being sidelined — identity loss, anxiety, isolation — is frequently overlooked. This project brings awareness, resources, and real stories to empower injured athletes on their mental recovery journey.
